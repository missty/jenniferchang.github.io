	                          <p>As one of the founding members, I participated right from the early stage of the company.
	                          The company Celuv is a startup company founded with the vision to become the next generation entertainment agency. 
	                          It was initially started with the idea to provide fans with information on upcoming concerts that they might be interested in.
	                          However, after user research and feedbacks from VCs and mentors, we pivoted our product to provide fans with updates on their favorite celebrities.
	                          Now, the company aims to help fans to stay closer to their favorite celebrities, and help agencies to manage the celebrities and their schedules more effectively. 
	                          As the Chief Product Officer, I led and managed the development of the Celuv mobile application and the Manager website.
	                          I also created the UX strategies, conducted user research and IA, and produced wireframes and prototypes for both the mobile app and the manager website.
	                          </p>
	                          
	                          <h4>Mobile Application</h4>
	                          <p>For the user research, interviews and surveys were conducted to understand different needs of users according to their levels of enthusiasm toward their favorite celebrities, from casual fans to fanatics.
	                          Users tend to like multiple celebrities from singers, actors, athletes, models, youtubers, to even politicians. And due to the different types of celebrities, thei information were scattered across multiple media channels, and fans had to spend significant amount of their time in order to stay updated with the upcoming events of these celebrities.<br/>
	                          The MVP focused on satisfying this key user need. (The app is currently under testing.)</p>

	                          <p>During my last two months with Celuv, I focused on building the Manager Website with which agencies and celebrities can manage their schedules.
	                          Based on the personas, user stories and user flows I created, I drew out the wireframes for the Manager Website which aims to provide agencies and managers with an easy and convenient tool to manage their celebrities and their schedules.</p>
